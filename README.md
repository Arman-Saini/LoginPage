App Work is in Progress.

Backend and Frontend are ready, available at https://github.com/Harshit24401/hackQts

The Basic idea of our project is to create a platform that helps manage e-waste and bring some, if not all of it, back into the economy.

We offer a portal on our website (soon to be integrated into the app too) that helps the generator of e-waste find the nearest e-waste recycling centre and contact with it.
This will help baseless disposal of electronics and will help them reach e-waste centres. The generator of the waste receives back some value of the expected recycled product.
Money is just an incentive, our aim is to track e-waste and help maximize it's recycling.
